# Rails

Rails is a mobile application that helps rail transit passengers to check the balance of their _beep card_ or _ticket_ in using the _LRT 1_, _LRT 2_, _MRT 3_. Rails indicates the exact number of passengers in a certain station and the user can check if the situation inside the destination is whether _light_, _moderate_, or _heavy_. Rails is secure from _SQL Injection_ to ensure that our data can never be stolen by anyone.
